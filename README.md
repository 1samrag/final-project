Project Format: Web map
 
Project Idea
We will be creating a web map displaying Native reservation sites and their proximity to natural gas plants across the United States crime statistics. The data set includes longitude and latitude information of federally acknowledged Native reservation sites, these sites will be depicted using different aesthetic icons, each representing the different native reservation sites. Upon clicking on the symbol, there will be a pop-up displaying the name and history of the Indian land. Depicted by using another unique symbol will be that of the natural gas plants. A scale will be on the map for reference.
With the data on different Indian reservations throughout the United States, we can identify the sites closest to natural gas plants. The United States census bureau provides us with  shapefiles of each reservation, from there we can identify where each location is in most critical or concerning distance from the gas plants using a dot density map.
 
Project Significance and Broader Impacts
With over half of Oklahoma being considered Native territory it is important to look at gas production industries in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is the US's top oil producing state ranking 4th in the nation. One fourth of Oklahoma's oil and gas wells are at 60%  if its refinery capacity and its operations are located in native territory. Its gas wells lie within five native tribes including the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole. The fracking pioneer Chesapeake Energy(One of Oklahoma's biggest energy firms), has  declared bankruptcy  due to Oklahoma's high extraction costs. Due to a great deal of Oklahoma being Native land, this generates greater regulation over the sacred land serving to protect its properties and wildlife. In addition to federal restrictions, in order to protect  endangered wildlife like, the beetle , drilling in Indian country is closely monitored. This project highlights the need for government intervention by regulation and laws to be put in place to preserve the land and what it means to its people. Environmental advocates are joining with Native American groups to fight against and sue to prevent pipeline projects from destroying the environment. 
 
Primary Functions and Major Data Sources
This map will be made to reach environmental activists and native regions who are concerned for the well being of sacred territory.  A map with symbols at each reservation location with symbols for gas plants will make native territory and its proximity to gas plants identifiable.
Our primary data source for crime statistics comes from the city of Seattle at https://www.census.gov/tribal/

Targeted Audience
Our project target audience includes residents and officials of native regions who are interested in ensuring the safety of their community and the longevity of their land. This map will outline which regions are most susceptible to the pollutants released by gas plants and this information can be useful in allowing residents to become aware of the problem and what future actions they can take to combat pollution and contamination. This map will also be helpful to inform government officials like lawmakers and policymakers who can work with Native residents to take the steps necessary to protect sacred land.
